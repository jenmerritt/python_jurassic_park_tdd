**Brief**

This brief is taken from my time studying at CodeClan. I have applied it here to learning Python.

**Jurassic Park**

John Hammond has tasked you with creating an app to help him manage his theme park. He needs to be able to track and manage information about the various dinosaurs in his park and the number of visitors that they will attract.

Use TDD and the following requirements about each Class:

A dinosaur must have:

- A species
- A diet (e.g. carnivore, herbivore or omnivore)
- An average number of visitors attracted per day

A park must have:

A park must be able to:

- Add a dinosaur to its collection of dinosaurs

*Extensions*

A park must be able to:
